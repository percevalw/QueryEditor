Query Editor
============

This project is an NodeJS/AngularJS webapp aimed at writing query for Mongo (eventually SQL db too) in the browser in a human-readable language through autocomplete features.

The autocomplete features are built on top of an ANTLR4 Grammar, transcripted in JS.

A minimal demo is available as a proof of concept at [mongo-editor.herokuapp.com](http://mongo-editor.herokuapp.com).

**This demo is barely working because I stopped working on it. If you have any question, feel free to contact me**
